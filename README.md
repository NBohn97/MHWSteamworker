# MHWSteamworker
Script for automating the Monster Hunter World steamworks game. 

The script will only run while Monster Hunter World is the active window.
You need to be in the Steamworks minigame starting screen (where you have to press space to begin) before running the script.
To stop the program either close the console or wait until the max. running time you entered has passed.

You can either use the executable file or run the python script yourself.
When running the python file make you all modules in the "requirements.txt" are installed.
